        "description": "Plex is like running your own personal Netflix server. The only thing that would make it better, since it's already free of charge, would be if it was open source. It runs on your server and gives a user friendly interface for interacting with it via a web browser, mobile apps on your phone, etc. Re-encoding is done by the server, so if you want to stream something on your phone over a cellular data connection, you can set it to a lower quality and the server re-encodes the stream in real time. This means your cell phone doesn't have to do any of the heavy lifting.\n\nIt lets you add a variety of media library types (Movies, TV Shows), automatically matches entries and pulls the metadata for them, supports embedded subtitles, etc. If somebody tries to play something in a format that device doesn't support, it re-encodes it in real time to a format that it does support.\n\nIt authenticates with plex.tv, but once you have a server set up, you can invite others to browse your Plex server and share your libraries with them. That also means that you don't have to manage the user accounts of people you want to share your server with, the Plex website basically acts as an authentication gateway for your server. You can create accounts for your children and then set parental controls on those accounts so that they do not see any content you don't want them to see.\n\nThe snap version means that it's contained, includes everything necessary, and can automatically keep itself up to date, so no more adding yet another third party repository or manually downloading and installing the new deb files whenever updates come out.",

I realize this is more difficult, but I've had some issues with the one from the Ubuntu Software app. Specifically it lost my entire library, which isn't a big deal -- the media files were still there -- but I had to re-categorize my files and fix the problematic matches.\n\nAdditionally, if you did already install Plex here and you then install Plex from the DEB file, you will have two Plex Media Servers in a race condition!\n\nThat being said, once you have your Plex Media Server installed and configured the way you want, you will probably want to buy the lifetime Plex membership. This gives you remote access from anywhere, an SSL cert for your Plex server, and a bunch of other goodies. Worth it and a good way to support the Plex developers.",
